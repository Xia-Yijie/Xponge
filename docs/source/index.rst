Xponge 1.2.6.6 Documentation
------------------------------------

What is Xponge?
    ``Xponge`` is a lightweight and easy to customize python package to perform pre- and post-processing of molecular simulations. 

What can Xponge do?
    ``Xponge`` is mainly designed for the molecular dynamics (MD) program `SPONGE <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/cjoc.202100456>`_, but it can also output some general format files such as mol2 and PDB, so it may help the other molecular modelling programs too.

How can I get Xponge?
    Xponge is available on all oerating systems (Windows/Linux/MacOS). See :ref:`installation` for detailed instructions.

    ``Xponge`` now is also a part of `MindSponge <https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindscience>`_ as toolkits. You can download and use ``Xponge`` with MindSponge.
