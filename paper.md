# Summary

Xponge is a lightweight and easy-customizing Python package to perform pre- and post-processing of molecular simulations. It is mainly disigned for the molecular dynamics (MD) program SPONGE`[@Huang:2022]`, but the preprocessing performance can be helpful to other molecular simulation programs.
