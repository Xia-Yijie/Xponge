abstract = {Comprehensive Summary SPONGE (Simulation Package tOward Next GEneration molecular modeling) is a software package for molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of solution and surface molecular systems. In this version of SPONGE, the all- atom potential energy functions used in AMBER MD packages are used by default and other all-atom/coarse- grained potential energy functions are also supported. SPONGE is designed to extend the timescale being approached in MD simulations by utilizing the latest CUDA- enabled graphical processing units (GPU) and adopting highly efficient enhanced sampling algorithms, such as integrated tempering, selective integrated tempering and enhanced sampling of reactive trajectories. It is highly modular and new algorithms and functions can be incorporated con veniently. Particularly, a specialized Python plugin can be easily used to perform the machine learning MD simulation with MindSpore, TensorFlow, PyTorch or other popular machine learning frameworks. Furthermore, a plugin of Finite-Element Method (FEM) is also available to handle metallic surface systems. All these advanced features increase the power of SPONGE for modeling and simulation of complex chemical and biological systems. What is the most favorite and original chemistry developed in your research group? Our research centers at developing methods and theories to unravel molecular mechanisms of chemical and biological systems. By establishing theoretical models, developing enhanced sampling methods combined with machine learning techniques, we are able to conduct comprehensive thermodynamic and dynamic analyses for these complex systems. How do you get into this specific field? Could you please share some experiences with our readers? I got into theoretical chemistry as a PhD student. My PhD adviser Prof. Rudolph A. Marcus led me into this field and inspired me by his love of science. Enjoy life, always learn new things and be independent in thinking are something I learnt from my advisers (Professors Dalin Yang, Qihe Zhu, Rudy Marcus, and Martin Karplus) and would love to pass to my students. How do you supervise your students? We learn from each other. What is the most important personality for scientific research? Curiosity, passion, and persistence have been of great value to my career. What are your hobbies? What's your favorite book(s)? Reading, Ping-Pong, and jogging. I always enjoy reading history. Who influences you mostly in your life? Too many, family, academic advisors, friends, students, and colleagues.},

abstract = {Abstract Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure–function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone ϕ, ψ dihedral crossterms or a ϕ, ψ grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the ϕ, ψ dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of ϕ and ψ in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {Abstract We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It has been tested on systems of millions of particles. Many common file formats of simulation packages including CHARMM, Gromacs, Amber, and NAMD and the Protein Data Bank format can be read and written. Atoms can be selected with a syntax similar to CHARMM's powerful selection commands. MDAnalysis enables both novice and experienced programmers to rapidly write their own analytical tools and access data stored in trajectories in an easily accessible manner that facilitates interactive explorative analysis.

The package provides a wide range of tools to support simulations of finite-size systems, extended systems with periodic boundary conditions, low-dimensional periodic systems, and custom Hamiltonians, using mean-field and post-mean-field methods with standard Gaussian basis functions. To ensure ease of extensibility, PySCF uses the Python language to implement almost all of its features, while computationally critical paths are implemented with heavily optimized C routines. Using this combined Python/C implementation, the package is as efficient as the best existing C or Fortran-based quantum chemistry programs.

abstract = {An efficient integral library Libcint was designed to automatically implement general integrals for Gaussian-type scalar and spinor basis functions. The library is able to evaluate arbitrary integral expressions on top of p, r and σ operators with one-electron overlap and nuclear attraction, two-electron Coulomb and Gaunt operators for segmented contracted and/or generated contracted basis in Cartesian, spherical or spinor form. Using a symbolic algebra tool, new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular properties. To demonstrate the capability of the integral library, we computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both nonrelativistic and 4-component relativistic Hartree–Fock level in this work. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives. The generality of the integral library is achieved without losing efficiency. On the modern multi-CPU platform, Libcint can easily reach the overall throughput being many times of the I/O bandwidth. On a 20-core node, we are able to achieve an average output 8.3 GB/s for C60 molecule with cc-pVTZ basis. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
